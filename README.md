DIYPOS
======

A browser based POS system run on the LAN of a business. Accessible by both company cell phone or company computer.

Haven't decided on the backend of project yet. Looking to have an admin account with more options than "employee" accounts
Would like admin to be able to add/remove and alter the prices of items.

Going to start simple with as little back end as possible. Looking to later upgrade to full blown device/software bundle for sale.
